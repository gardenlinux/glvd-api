== API Endpoints

This document describes the HTTP API endpoints of Garden Linux Vulnerability Database.

CAUTION: This document and the API are work in progress and subject to change at any time.

=== Get a list of CVEs by distro

To query all CVEs for a given distribution by version, you may use this endpoint:

include::{snippets}/getCveForDistro/curl-request.adoc[]

TIP: For all the endpoints: The `sortBy` and `sortOrder` query parameters are optional. If omitted, default sorting will be applied.

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/getCveForDistro/http-response.adoc[]

=== Get a list of CVEs for packages by distro

This endpoint will give you all the CVE for a list of packages in a specified distro.
Note that the package names are comma separated (this might be changed later).
You may or may not need to url-encode the commas.

include::{snippets}/getCveForPackages/curl-request.adoc[]

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/getCveForPackages/http-response.adoc[]

=== Get a list of CVEs for packages by distro via PUT

This endpoint will give you all the CVE for a list of packages in a specified distro.
Package names are provided in the request body in json-encoded form.

include::{snippets}/getCveForPackagesPut/curl-request.adoc[]

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/getCveForPackagesPut/http-response.adoc[]

=== Get List of Packages

Just gives you a list of packages in a given distribution.

include::{snippets}/getPackages/curl-request.adoc[]

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/getPackages/http-response.adoc[]

=== Get Package With Vulnerabilities

Gives you a list of vulnerabilities for a specific package.

include::{snippets}/getPackageWithVulnerabilities/curl-request.adoc[]

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/getPackageWithVulnerabilities/http-response.adoc[]

=== Get Package With Vulnerabilities by Version

Gives you a list of vulnerabilities for a specific package with the specified version.

include::{snippets}/getPackageWithVulnerabilitiesByVersion/curl-request.adoc[]

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/getPackageWithVulnerabilitiesByVersion/http-response.adoc[]

=== Get Packages By Vulnerabilities

Give a list of affected packages by vulnerability

include::{snippets}/getPackagesByVulnerability/curl-request.adoc[]

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/getPackagesByVulnerability/http-response.adoc[]

=== Get CVE Details with Contexts

Give information on a CVE by CVE ID

include::{snippets}/getCveDetailsWithContexts/curl-request.adoc[]

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/getCveDetailsWithContexts/http-response.adoc[]

==== Linux Kernel CVEs

For CVEs that match the linux kernel, the structure of the response is different.
This is because unlike for other CVEs, we can't take the data from the Debian Security Tracker, and take them from the upstream Linux kernel git repo instead.

include::{snippets}/getCveDetailsWithContextsKernel/curl-request.adoc[]

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/getCveDetailsWithContextsKernel/http-response.adoc[]


=== Get Patch Release Notes Information

Get information about fixed security vulnerabilities in a new patch release.

include::{snippets}/patchReleaseNotes/curl-request.adoc[]

The expected response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/patchReleaseNotes/http-response.adoc[]
